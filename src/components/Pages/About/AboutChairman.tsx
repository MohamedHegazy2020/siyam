        Since I started this business in 1992, as a small radiator factory in Jordan, our target has been to establish
        an outstanding brand and reputation for our products and services. We achieve this target by being honest with
        our customers, meeting their expectations, and investing in our capabilities. As the world is changing fast, we
        are changing with it. At Ibrahim Siyam Industrial Group, we are committed to continuously improve our processes,
        use the latest technology, and develop our products to exceed our customerâ€™s expectation. Our strategy has
        placed us amongst the leading radiator manufacturers in the Arab world, enabling us to supply our product to
        both OEM & after market in more than 26 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. I would like to
        thank our customers, suppliers, employees and my family for their continious support to achieve this vision.
